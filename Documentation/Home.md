The Home page is the default page of the kiosk application.  It is divided up into a number of tiles:
* Current weather conditions.  This is the large tile in the upper left corner.  It also includes some forecast information for the current day.  Clicking on the tile will display a graph page, which shows the forecast temperature, wind, and precipitation by hour for the current day.
* Current date and time.  Immediately to the right of the current weather conditions tile.  Underneath the date, icons will optionally be displayed indicating various calendar events.
* Transit information.  Immediately below the date/time tile, this will show the time to the next bus.  This tile only displays data between 4am and 8am (in order to keep from bombing the transit system's servers).
* Five day forecast.  This consists of five tiles along the bottom of the page.  Clicking on one of the first two tiles will bring up the forecast graphs for that day.
* Nav bar.  Displayed along the left edge of the page, this allows the user to select other pages.
